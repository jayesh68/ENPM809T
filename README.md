<h1> Project Overview </h1>
The theme of this project is to move three objects from a start location to a destination location using different hardware and software components. The hardware components include Raspberry Pi 3B+, picamera,ultrasonic distance sensor, IMU. The programming and sotware tools include python and leveraging openCV libraries. The theme of the project was based on the Covid-19 panademic where a robot would pickup the vaccines from a cold storage area and deliver them to the injection area. To complete the challenge one had to come up with a prototype to ensure that three such colored objects are moved from the start point to the destination point.

<h1>Project Objectives</h1>
<ul>
  <li>To complete assembly of the robot.
  <li>To recognize QR codes and act according to the information in the QR code.</li>
  <li>To perform object detection using image processing methods</li>
  <li>To setup and environment which would have two indicators to point the robot to the destination location</li>
  <li>To ensure that the robot is capable of detecting obstacles.</li>
  <li>To grasp objects using Computer Vision techniques based on the distance the object is from the camera.</li>
  <li>To perform facial detection before dropping the part at the destination location.</li>
</ul>
